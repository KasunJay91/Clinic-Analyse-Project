Overview

As a Data Analyst, I developed an interactive dashboard for Yass Health Clinic to provide actionable insights into patient visits, satisfaction trends, and departmental performance. This project aimed to improve healthcare services by identifying operational inefficiencies and enabling data-driven decision-making. The dashboard served as a centralised tool for stakeholders to track key metrics and trends, empowering them to optimise patient flow and resource allocation. By leveraging Power BI and Power Query Editor, I ensured the data preparation process was efficient, automated, and scalable. Advanced visualisation techniques were used to create intuitive and interactive visuals, making complex data accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

This project demonstrated my ability to handle large datasets, implement advanced analytics, and design dashboards tailored to specific stakeholder requirements. Furthermore, the insights provided helped the clinic identify high-traffic periods, demographic trends, and areas requiring immediate attention. The final solution aligned with the clinic's goal of delivering high-quality, patient-centred care while improving operational efficiency.

Project Environment and Workflow
